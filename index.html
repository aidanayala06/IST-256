<h2 style="font-family: time new roman;">Early Life</h2>
<hr>

<p >Aidan was born in 2005 in <a style="color: #0000FF;" href="https://www.plymouthmi.gov/"> Plymouth, Michigan </a>, to a supportive family with his parents and brother. Growing up, Aidan was an active child, with a strong passion for sports, especially baseball, which became
    a central part of his childhood. Alongside sports, he also developed an interest in music, playing the violin and saxophone, though he later focused more on baseball and basketball.
    Aidan and his brother were very close,
    spending much of their time together, which strengthened their bond and shaped Aidan’s sense of family. His parents encouraged him to pursue whatever he felt passionate towards at the time.
This lead to Aidan taking part in a lot of different sports programs some of which included basketball, baseball, as well as soccer. However, one sport that really caught Aidan's attention was baseball.
He constantly watched the Detroit Tigers with his grandpa and would often love to talk baseball. This is what would later lead to his obsession with baseball which lasted all the way until he departed for college.
Another significant part of his life was video games. Although early on Aidan did not play too many by the time he was in middle school the Wii already had become very familiar to him. As he grew older into his teenage
years he bought a ps4 and later his very first PC which played a big part in what lead him to his career.</p>

    <p >Aidan is an aspiring cybersecurity professional currently studying at Penn State Berks, with plans to further his education at Penn State’s main campus next year. Aidan’s journey into the world of technology and cybersecurity began at a young age, driven by an early fascination with computers and problem-solving. This passion for technology has been the cornerstone of his academic and career pursuits.
        Growing up, Aidan excelled in subjects related to math and technology. During high school, he was not only a dedicated student but also an active participant in extracurricular activities, including baseball and <a style="color: #0000FF;" href="https://hosa.org/" target="_blank"> HOSA </a> (Health Occupations Students of America).
        These experiences helped Aidan develop crucial life skills, such as teamwork, leadership, and the ability to balance multiple responsibilities effectively. It was also during high school that Aidan discovered a deep interest in the tech world, particularly through his involvement in the SITS (Student Information Technology Services) program. As a main contributor to the program,
        Aidan worked alongside peers to refurbish and distribute computers to those in need, gaining hands-on experience in computer repair and technology troubleshooting. This experience sparked a desire to pursue a career where he could combine his problem-solving skills with his love of technology.
        After graduating from high school, Aidan enrolled at <a style="color: #0000FF;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University" target="_blank"> Penn State</a> Berks, where he chose to major in Cybersecurity a field that blends his technical abilities with the ever-growing demand for online safety and data protection. At Berks, Aidan has built a strong foundation in his chosen field, focusing on both the theoretical and practical aspects of cybersecurity. The transition to Penn State’s main campus next year will allow him to expand his knowledge and skills even further, with a goal of becoming a leading professional in the cybersecurity industry.
        In addition to his studies, Aidan has gained valuable work experience through his position at <a style="color: #0000FF;" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/" target="_blank"> Best Buy </a> as a member of the Geek Squad. This role has allowed him to apply his technical skills in a real-world environment, assisting customers with a variety of tech-related issues. Whether diagnosing problems with computers, repairing devices, or providing customer support, Aidan enjoys the hands-on nature of the job and the opportunity to directly impact others by solving their tech issues. The job has reinforced his passion for technology and further solidified his career aspirations in the field of cybersecurity.
        Before joining Best Buy, Aidan worked as a busboy at an Italian restaurant an experience that, while not directly related to his current career, played a pivotal role in shaping his work ethic and personal growth. The job taught him the value of hard work, attention to detail, and providing excellent service, all of which continue to serve him well in his current role and in his professional life.
        Looking to the future, Aidan is excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in the field of cybersecurity. With a strong academic background, a growing body of hands-on experience, and a deep passion for technology, he is eager to continue advancing in his education and career.
